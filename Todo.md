# Dezmo Project

## Monday 15th March

### Homework 
 [x] upload images, and text for two engineers pages

### What dis we do in the session

`<TemplateCard>` clean this up, used it only for headers

### What did we learn

- [Array destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) to remove first element from a 
- Super component that does everything, can cause unnecessary complexity and bugs 
- flex shorthand can cause confusion, especially if you are new to it. `flex: 0 0 50%` is equal to `flex-grow: 0; flex-shrink: 0; flex-basis: 50%;` maybe do flexbox refresh
- When a container has flex, the child elements generally don't have width or heights
- Comments in code can cause confusion and clutter

## Next session

Maybe weekend, to be confirmed
