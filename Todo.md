`<HeroCard>` clean this up, used it only for headers

### What did we learn

- [Array destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) to remove first element from a
- Super component that does everything, can cause unnecessary complexity and bugs
- flex shorthand can cause confusion, especiall if you are new to it. `flex: 0 0 50%` is equal to `flex-grow: 0; flex-shrink: 0; flex-basis: 50%;` maybe do flexbox refresh
- When a container has flex, the child elements generally don't have width or heights
- Comments in code can cause confusion and clutter
